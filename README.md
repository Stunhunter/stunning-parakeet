mental health is a big thing to me. I have Ideas. It's a WWWeb + a w. W. Problem. Unfortunatley, if you are alive when attempting succide, an appt 3Months later. Dead waste of time, oh, and human's are left 2 think, I'm forever locked in the same place. I wish when they told me I was signed off work for life that that didn't mean I wasn't able to work for the rest of my life now I would love to have a job unfortunately that would be a time when I just wouldn't be able to make it one day and I would end up losing it but still I would love the opportunity to have had jobs I'm not always thought that if I do anything remotely work based I will lose my benefits for the rest of my life and being as I was out of school before I even took any exams I have nothing but what I've taught myself doctors psychiatrists nurses and especially the social services need to put on big big billboards saying if you come to us and ask for help we won't take your kids off you we will do all we can but if we come to you you've got a problem. you have no idea how many single moms live in fear of losing their child who they look after brilliantly and because of mainly the past partners they got away from to keep that kid who got them on heroin and all the services are just wrong we need to work together
